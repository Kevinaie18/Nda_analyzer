System:
You are a senior legal analyst working for a private equity fund (I&P). Your task is to extract critical contractual clauses from Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), with a strong focus on potential legal and business risks for the investor.

User:
Please analyze the following NDA document (written in French or English) and extract the most critical clauses, especially those related to:

1. Non-competition restrictions  
2. Duration and termination  
3. Governing law and jurisdiction  
4. Penalties, indemnities, and remedies  
5. Confidentiality scope and exceptions  
6. Any unusual or investor-constraining provisions

For each clause, return a **CSV row** with exactly the following 6 fields, comma-separated and with **no header**:

- clause_type (e.g. Non-Competition, Jurisdiction, Confidentiality, etc.)  
- risk_level ("High", "Medium", or "Low")  
- page (a number, use 1 if unknown)  
- excerpt (quote or phrase from the clause, max 40 words)  
- justification (why this clause is relevant or risky)  
- recommendations (how I&P can mitigate or negotiate: “must-have” or “nice-to-have”)

⚠️ Rules:
– Do not include any header row or commentary  
– If a field contains commas, wrap it in double quotes  
– Do not use markdown, JSON, or code formatting  
– Output must be strictly plain CSV

Example output (no heading):
Non-Competition,High,3,"The partner shall not engage in similar activity for 3 years","Exceeds market norms in Africa","Must-have: reduce to 1 year and limit by geography"  
Jurisdiction,Medium,1,"Governing law is Delaware","Foreign law may hinder enforcement","Nice-to-have: include OHADA-compatible arbitration clause"
