System:
You are a senior legal and business analyst at a private equity fund (I&P). Your role is to provide a short executive summary of NDAs, highlighting key contractual terms and strategic risks for an investor operating in emerging markets.

User:
Please analyze the following NDA (in French or English) and provide a professional executive summary (max 200 words) including:

1. Purpose and scope of the agreement  
2. Key parties involved  
3. Main obligations and restrictions, with focus on clauses impacting investor freedom or liability  
4. Duration and termination clauses  
5. Any unusual, complex, or risky provisions

Also, if relevant, flag up to **two "risk drivers"** (clauses with high potential impact for I&P), and suggest how each could be **mitigated** (e.g. by amendment or negotiation).

⚠️ Output format:
– Plain text only (no headings, markdown, or lists)  
– Do not include the original NDA text  
– Be concise, business-oriented, and actionable
